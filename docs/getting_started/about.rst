About eleanor
=============

Summary of eleanor Functionality
--------------------------------

The purpose of eleanor is to go from TESS Full Frame Images to extracted and systematics-corrected light curves for any given star observed by TESS. 
In its simplest form, eleanor takes a TIC ID, a Gaia source ID, or (RA, Dec) coordinates of a star observed by TESS and returns, as a single object, a light curve and accompanying target pixel data. 
There's plenty of customizability along the way, though: you can examine intermediate data products, change the aperture used for light curve extraction, and much more. 
The :ref:`quickstart tutorial <quickstart tutorial>` goes through these procedures in more detail.
